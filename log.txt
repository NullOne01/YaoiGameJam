        When I tried to reach for the window handle I accidentally stepped on my backpack and all my notebooks scattered on the floor. Fuck. 
    
        What's here? My maths exercise book... 
    
        I guess it's the messiest one. Pencil marks on the cover, ripped pages and meaningless doodles. Maths is boring, huh. 
    
        A school diary... Another messy thing. I don't give a fuck why does this stuff exists. 
    
        Huh, the draft of my chemistry test answers. 
    
        It was today but feels like a week ago. And [CRUSH]. 
    
        Oh. [NERD_GIRL]. 
    
        Her phone on the margin. 
    
        A sociable girl, I may say. 
    
        Ah, [MH], don't be like that. Maybe she really liked you. Couldn't she? She could. 
    
        At least you need to thank her. That would be polite. She helped you. 
    
        Or was that [CRUSH] who did? 
    
        It doesn't matter for now. 
    
        I should text her and then decide what I'll do next. 
    
        My fingers make proud taps on the keyboard of the phone. 
    
        I text her "Hey, it's [MH] from chemistry" 
                                                   ^
    
        Now wait. 
    
        A poem. That's fucking hilarious. I hate myself for agreeing but I would do the same if I said no. So easy and so stupid. 
    
        I just need to write something. Even some nonsense. 
    
        "Beep" 
    
        Uh, the phone. My savior.

        I shuddered. Wait, that's not my name. But he's there. 
    
        I notice his dark hair among the crowd and look down. Huh. 
    
        His appearance here seems kind of embarrassing. For me, of course. 
    
        The voice that called [CRUSH] didn't sound again. 
    
        [CRUSH] came to school one more time? He does it so rarely it feels like a blessing for our poor headmaster. 
    
        She wanted to deduct him for three times but something stopped her. Maybe it's 'cause he acted like a normal student for a week when there were signs they wanted to deduct him. 
    
        Maybe it's 'cause of his parents. We don't know who they are but it seems this type of a son is always brought up by a special type of parents. 
    
        Even though we were friends… many years ago… I still didn't know a thing about his parents.
    
        Of course, this is none of our business but it could explain a lot about him. 
    
        He acts like he doesn't care and the thing is that.. maybe he really doesn't care? 
    
        Kids that were brought up by "basic" people don't do this. They may act but in fact they care.
